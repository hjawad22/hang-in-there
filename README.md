### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We built an app that users can interact with in different ways. There are many cool features like the ablity to create a new motivational poster by inputing text and an image into the create your own poster form. Another great feature is the ability to save multiple posters and view them at a later time. The app is solving the need for inspiration and motivation a lot of people are lacking. By using our application users have the ability to create the motivation they crave! They will have access to creating posters that inspire them as well as posters that others have created. The ability to save posters is also solving the problem of having to sort through many to find the posters that speak to the user the most.
